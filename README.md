# House Price Prediction Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California based on several features such as population size, median income, and more. This model utilizes the California census dataset, which includes data for each block group (smallest geographical subdivision) within the state. Each block group typically encompasses a population of 600 to 3,000 individuals. In this project, we refer to these block groups as "districts".

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the California census dataset. It includes various metrics for each district such as:

- Population size
- Median income
- Median housing prices
- and more

These metrics are used as features to train the model. The target variable is the median housing price.

## Model

The machine learning model built in this project is a regression model, as the target variable is a continuous value (median housing price). The specific type of model, along with the training method and the evaluation metrics used, will be specified in the Jupyter notebook that contains the project code.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages. Then, run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

```
git clone https://github.com/Nahsc0/House_Prediction_Model.git
cd House_Prediction_Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Once the Jupyter notebook is open, you can run the cells to load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
